# Functional Modular Architecture Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

Functional Modular Architecture (FMA) is a design approach that emphasizes simplicity through composition . Instead of building complex class hierarchies or monolithic structures, you organize your codebase as a collection of small, focused functions grouped into cohesive modules. This creates systems that are predictable, testable, and easy to reason about.

## Architectural System Description

### The Foundation: Pure Functions

At its core, FMA builds systems using pure functions - functions that are completely predictable and don't cause side effects. These functions form the building blocks of your architecture because they're reliable, testable, and can be safely combined in any order.

### Module Organization: Domain-Driven Structure

Rather than organizing code by technical concerns (controllers, services, utilities), FMA organizes modules by business domains . Each module contains all the functions needed to handle a specific area of your business logic. This creates natural boundaries that align with how your team thinks about the problem space.

### Composition Over Complexity

Instead of building complex inheritance hierarchies or tightly coupled classes, FMA creates sophisticated behavior by composing simple functions . This approach makes systems more flexible because you can easily recombine existing pieces to create new functionality.

### Explicit Data Flow

FMA makes data transformations visible and traceable . When you look at a function pipeline, you can clearly see how data flows from input to output. This transparency makes debugging easier and helps new team members understand the system quickly.

### Effect Isolation

The architecture separates pure business logic from side effects (database calls, API requests, file operations). Pure logic handles the "what" of your business rules, while effect wrappers handle the "how" of interacting with external systems.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pipeline Architecture

Data flows through your system like water through pipes. Each function in the pipeline transforms the data in a specific way, and you can easily add, remove, or reorder transformations without affecting other parts of the system.

### Module Federation

Core utilities and shared functions live in a central location, while domain-specific modules import only what they need. This creates a clear dependency hierarchy that prevents circular dependencies and makes the system easier to understand.

### Layered Composition

Functions are composed in layers - from simple utilities at the bottom, to domain functions in the middle, to complete workflows at the top. Each layer builds on the previous one, creating a stable foundation.

## When FMA Works Best

Ideal for:

- Data processing systems where information flows through predictable transformations
- API services that need to validate, transform, and route data
- Business logic heavy applications with complex rules and calculations
- Microservices that need to be independently deployable and testable
- CLI tools and scripts that process inputs and produce outputs
  Less suitable for:

- Highly stateful UIs with complex user interactions and real-time updates
- Performance-critical systems where every millisecond matters
- Legacy systems heavily invested in object-oriented patterns

## Architectural Benefits

### Predictability

Pure functions always behave the same way, making your system's behavior predictable and reducing unexpected bugs.

### Testability

Each function can be tested in isolation without complex setup, mocking, or teardown procedures.

### Maintainability

Changes are localized to specific modules, and dependencies are explicit, making it safe to modify code.

### Team Scalability

Different teams can work on different modules without stepping on each other's toes.

### Debugging Simplicity

When something goes wrong, you can trace the data flow step by step to find exactly where the problem occurs.

## Simple TypeScript Example

Here's a straightforward example of how FMA might structure a user registration system:

```
// Core types
type User = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  name: string;
};

type ValidationResult = {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: string[];
};

// Pure validation functions
const validateEmail = (email: string): boolean => 
  /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);

const validatePassword = (password: string): boolean => 
  password.length >= 8;

const validateUser = (user: User): ValidationResult => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  if (!validateEmail(user.email)) errors.push('Invalid email');
  if (!validatePassword(user.password)) errors.push('Password too short');
  if (!user.name.trim()) errors.push('Name required');
  
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors
  };
};

// Pure transformation functions
const normalizeUser = (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  email: user.email.toLowerCase().trim(),
  name: user.name.trim()
});

// Composition function
const processUserRegistration = (userData: User) => {
  const normalized = normalizeUser(userData);
  const validation = validateUser(normalized);
  
  if (!validation.isValid) {
    throw new Error(`Validation failed: ${validation.errors.join(', ')}`);
  }
  
  return normalized;
};

// Effect wrapper (handles side effects)
const registerUser = async (userData: User): Promise<User> => {
  const processedUser = processUserRegistration(userData); // Pure logic
  
  // Side effects isolated here
  await saveUserToDatabase(processedUser);
  await sendWelcomeEmail(processedUser.email);
  
  return processedUser;
};
```

This example shows how FMA creates clear separation between pure business logic (validation, normalization) and side effects (database operations, email sending), making the system easy to test and maintain.

## Getting Started

1. 1. Identify your domains - What are the main areas of functionality in your system?
2. 2. Extract pure functions - Start by pulling out functions that don't have side effects
3. 3. Group by purpose - Organize related functions into domain modules
4. 4. Build composition helpers - Create utilities for combining functions
5. 5. Isolate effects - Separate pure logic from database calls, API requests, etc.
6. 6. Test incrementally - Pure functions are easy to test, so test as you go
      FMA creates systems that are simple to understand, easy to test, and straightforward to maintain while remaining powerful enough to handle complex business requirements. The key is starting small and building up through composition rather than trying to design everything upfront.
