- üîß **Simple configuration** - one YAML file to rule them all

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the workflow to your repository

Create `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: AI Review
        uses: gundurraga/bad-buggy@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ai-provider: "anthropic" # or 'openrouter'
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }} # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
          model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307" # or claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
```

### 2. Set up your API key

Go to your repository's Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, and add:

- For Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- For OpenRouter: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

### 3. (Optional) Customize the review

Create `.github/ai-review-config.yml`:

```yaml
# Review customization
review_prompt: |
  You are reviewing code for a Node.js web application.
  Focus on security, performance, and maintainability.
  Be constructive and suggest improvements.

# Comment settings
max_comments: 10
prioritize_by_severity: true

# What to review
review_aspects:
  - security_vulnerabilities
  - performance_issues
  - code_duplication
  - best_practices
  - architecture_suggestions
  - product_improvements

# Files to skip
ignore_patterns:
  - "*.md"
  - "*.json"
  - "tests/*"
```

## Cost Tracking

bad-buggy automatically calculates and displays the cost of each review in the PR comments:

```
üê∞ bad-buggy review completed with 5 comments

**Review Cost:**
- Model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
- Total cost: $0.0018
- Tokens: 2,543 input, 856 output
```

### Estimated Costs

| Model           | Cost per 1M tokens         | Avg PR Cost |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Claude 3 Haiku  | $0.25 input / $1.25 output | ~$0.002     |
| Claude 4 Sonnet | $3 input / $15 output      | ~$0.02      |

## Examples

### Security-Focused Configuration

```yaml
review_prompt: |
  You are a security expert reviewing code.
  Look for: SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, 
  data exposure, and dependency vulnerabilities.

review_aspects:
  - security_vulnerabilities
  - authentication_issues
  - data_validation
```

### Architecture Review Configuration

```yaml
review_prompt: |
  Focus on high-level architecture and design patterns.
  Suggest improvements for scalability and maintainability.
  Consider microservices principles and clean architecture.

max_comments: 5
review_aspects:
  - architecture_suggestions
  - design_patterns
  - scalability_concerns
```

### Minimal Setup for bad-buggy itself

```yaml
name: bad-buggy self-review
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: gundurraga/bad-buggy@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ai-provider: "anthropic"
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307"
```

## How It Works

1. **Triggered on PR**: The action runs when a PR is opened or updated
2. **Fetches changes**: Gets the diff of all changed files
3. **Chunks intelligently**: Splits large PRs into manageable pieces
4. **Reviews with AI**: Sends chunks to AI with your custom prompt
5. **Posts comments**: Adds review comments directly on the PR
6. **Shows costs**: Reports the total cost of the review

### How Comments Appear

bad-buggy posts reviews as:

- **Inline comments** on specific lines of code
- **Summary comment** with total cost and review statistics
- Uses the GitHub Actions bot profile picture
- Groups all comments in a single review

Example summary comment:

```
üê∞ bad-buggy review completed with 5 comments

**Review Cost:**
- Model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
- Total cost: $0.0018
- Tokens: 2,543 input, 856 output
```
